# Overview

The tile overview displays a node for each tile-map present in the [assets](/projects/assets.md) tile-map directory.

The icon displayed for the node is the tile set as default in the details view.

You can set the **grid size** of the tile-map (the size of the tiles in the tile-map) by clicking on the *Grid Size* property of the node.
