# Skill Tree

Defines a skill. Rename the node to reflect the skill you want to implement.

### If this node is used in *Systems / Skills*:

It will define a new skill. The [Skill Level](skill_level.md) nodes attached to the skill tree define the different levels of the skill. I.e. how many times the skill has to be used to reach the next level (and the name of the levels).

### If this node is used in an *Item*:

It defines which skill the item will increment on use and the property and speed values for each level of the skill.
