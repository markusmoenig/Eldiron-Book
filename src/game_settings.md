# Game Settings

The game settings define global poperties for your game. Here is a list of all supported properties.

```rust
// The screen size of the game window.
screen_size = 1024, 608
```

This setting defines the size of your game window.

---

```rust
// The default square tile size when drawing game content.
square_tile_size = 32
```

The size of a square tile when drawing game content.

---

```rust
// The variable name of your primary currency. "gold" by default.
primary_currency = "gold"
// The variable name of your (optional) secondary currency. "silver" by default.
secondary_currency = "silver"
// How much secondary currency makes up one primary. 100 by default.
secondary_to_primary = 100
```

The variable name of your primary currency. You would assign currency to your character via a startup tree, like ```rust let gold = 10;```. The *primary_currency* setting lets Eldiron know which variable in the character scope defines the primary currency.

---

```rust
// The name of the characters hitpoints variable.
hitpoints = "HP"
// The name of the characters maximum hitpoints variable.
max_hitpoints = "MAX_HP"
```

The values define the name of your characters hitpoint and maximum hitpoints variables. The node system needs to know what script variables are used to calculate damage, when you character is dead or what is your current maximum hitpoint value when being healed. If you change these values in the settings make sure to change them in your scripts.

```admonish Note
Secondary currencies are not yet supported. This will be added in the future.
