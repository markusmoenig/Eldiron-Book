# Installation

## Installing from source

Eldiron is written in Rust, to run it you have to install Rust and its package manager cargo. Please follow the instructions on this [page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After you successfully installed Rust, clone the [repository](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron) (or download the source via a .zip file), open a terminal, navigate to the Eldiron directory and start Eldiron Creator with `cargo run --release`.

## Prebuilt Binaries

At a later stage I will provide pre-build binaries for each platform.
