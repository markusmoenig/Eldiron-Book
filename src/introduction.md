# Introduction

[Eldiron](https://eldiron.com) is a cross-platform creator for classic role-playing-games (RPGs). It's main aim is to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80's and 90's but with modern features as well as support for single and multi-player experiences.

Eldiron consists of **Eldiron Creator**, a desktop application available for macOS, Windows and Linux, and various clients (and a server) which will run the created games on nearly any device.

Eldiron v1.0 is under active development and scheduled for Q1 2023. V1 will be able to create games similar to Ultima 4 and 5 with 3D retro regions and dungeons scheduled for v1.5.

Later goals are support for more perspectives (like isometric) and much more.
