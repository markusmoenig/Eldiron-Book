# Introduction

[Eldiron](https://eldiron.com) is a cross-platform creator for classic role-playing-games (RPGs). It's main aim is to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80's and 90's but with modern features as well as support for single and multi-player experiences.

Eldiron consists of **Eldiron Creator**, a desktop application available for macOS, Windows and Linux, and various clients (and a server) which will run the created games on nearly any device.

Whenever you see the name *Eldiron* in this book it references *Eldiron Creator*, the clients and other tools will be referenced explicitly by name.
