# Introduction

Eldiron is a cross-platform creator for role-playing-games (RPGs).

Eldiron consists of **Eldiron Creator** which has these features:

* Import tile-maps and assign a category and/or tags to each tile. Eldiron comes with a range of default tile-maps but you can use your own too.
* Draw regions (like cities, dungeons or the world itself) using the region editor.
* Create behavior for characters, region areas, items and game logic using a sophisticated yet easy-to-use node system which has a full, optional, scripting backend.
* Play and/or visually debug your game.

Apart from the creator, Eldiron consists of server and client components which I will document over time. You will be able to use Eldiron to create single player, multi-player (MMO) or instanced multi-player experiences for every platform.
