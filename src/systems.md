# Systems View: Overview

Systems are [node graphs](./nodegraph.md) which characters can invoke to perform certain kind of behavior, like combat or crafting or any other kind of action.

Systems make it possible to have a modular set of graphs which can be invoked at any time from any character. Internally they work the same as character graphs.
