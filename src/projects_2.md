# Projects

Eldiron stores it's game projects in the *Eldiron* directory in your desktops *Documents* directory. When first started Eldiron will ask for the name of your first game project (the default name is *New Game*) and create the project with the default starter content.

When Eldiron is not running, you can rename game folders to change the name of the game, delete or copy game folders.

The design goal for Eldiron projects was to make sharing of game content between games as easy as possible. Most game components are saved in individual files to allow sharing them with others. Each section of this book will mention where the corresponding game data is saved.

Game projects consists of two directories: *assets* and *game*.
